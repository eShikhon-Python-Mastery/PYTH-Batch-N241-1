## What is Database?

A database is a collection of organized information that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

### Example

Imagine you have a notebook where you keep track of your friend's contact information. Each page represents a different friend's details, such as their name, phone number, email address, and home address. This notebook is like a database, and each page is a record containing the data about each friend.

In a digital database, instead of a physical notebook, you use software to store and manage the data. Here’s a simple example using a table:

| ID  | Name     | Phone Number  | Email             | Address       |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | John Doe | 123-456-7890  | john@example.com  | 123 Maple St. |
| 2   | Jane Doe | 987-654-3210  | jane@example.com  | 456 Oak St.   |

- ID: A unique identifier for each record.
- Name: The name of the person.
- Phone Number: Their contact number.
- Email: Their email address.
- Address: Where they live.

With this digital table, you can quickly search for a friend’s details, update their contact information, or add new friends to your database.

## What is database management system?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps you create, manage, and interact with databases. It provides tools and features to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently while ensuring security, accuracy, and consistency.

> Key Functions of a DBMS
1. Data Storage: Organizes and stores data in a structured way.
2. Data Retrieval: Allows users to quickly find and retrieve specific data using queries.
3. Data Update: Facilitates the modification and updating of data.
4. Data Deletion: Enables the removal of data that is no longer needed.
5. Security: Ensures that only authorized users can access or modify the data.
6. Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms to backup data and recover it in case of failures.
7. Concurrency Control: Manages simultaneous data access by multiple users without conflicts.
8. Data Integrity: Maintains accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle.

### Example

Imagine a library that uses a DBMS to manage its inventory of books. The database contains tables with information about books, authors, members, and borrowings.

Table: Books

| Book ID | Title                   | Author ID | Genre   | Available Copies |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1       | The Great Gatsby        | 101       | Fiction | 3                |
| 2       | To Kill a Mockingbird   | 102       | Fiction | 5                |

Table: Authors

| Author ID | Name                 | Nationality |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 101       | F. Scott Fitzgerald  | American    |
| 102       | Harper Lee           | American    |

Table: Members

| Member ID | Name           | Membership Date |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1001      | Alice Johnson  | 2022-01-15       |
| 1002      | Bob Smith      | 2023-05-22       |

Table: Borrowings

| Borrowing ID | Member ID | Book ID | Borrow Date | Return Date |
| ------------- | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1             | 1001      | 1       | 2023-06-01  | 2023-06-15  |
| 2             | 1002      | 2       | 2023-06-05  | 2023-06-19  |

> Using the DBMS, the library staff can:

- Add new books and members to the database.
- Search for books by title, author, or genre.
- Update book availability when a book is borrowed or returned.
- Track borrowings to see which books are currently borrowed and by whom.
- Generate reports on popular books, active members, and more.

Popular DBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.

> Pros:
1. Reduces data redundancy and inconsistency
2. Enhances data security and integrity
3. Facilitates data sharing and efficient management
4. Provides robust backup and recovery mechanisms

> Cons:
1. Complex setup and management
2. High cost for licensing and maintenance
3. Performance overhead and resource consumption
4. Requires regular maintenance and can be a single point of failure
5. Challenges in data migration between different DBMS platforms
